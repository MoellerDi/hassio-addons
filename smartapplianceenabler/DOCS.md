# Home Assistant Add-on: Smart Appliance Enabler

## How to use

This add-on is based on Smart Appliance Enabler. I just made it to work as add-on for Home Assistant to avoid to setup of another Raspberry Pi.
All credit goes to Mr Carl Axel Mueller for his hard work and development of Smart Appliance Enabler. For detailed documentation see his github page at https://github.com/camueller/SmartApplianceEnabler

Sadly I did not manage to make HA ingress be working as of now.
Therefore you need to access the configuration web portal via <b>http://\<ip of your home assistant>:\<sae www port></b>
