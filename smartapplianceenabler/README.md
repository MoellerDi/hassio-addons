# Home Assistant Add-on: SmartApplianceEnabler

_The Smart Appliance Enabler is a software for integrating any device (Wallbox, heat pump, washing machine, dishwasher, ...) with the Sunny Home Manager by SMA._

This add-on is based on Smart Appliance Enabler. I just made it to work as add-on for Home Assistant to avoid to setup of another Raspberry Pi.
All credit goes to Mr Carl Axel Mueller for his hard work and development of Smart Appliance Enabler. For detailed documentation see his github page at https://github.com/camueller/SmartApplianceEnabler

Sadly HA ingress is not working as of now.
Therefore you need to access the configuration web portal via <b>http://<ip of your home assistant>:<sae www port></b>
